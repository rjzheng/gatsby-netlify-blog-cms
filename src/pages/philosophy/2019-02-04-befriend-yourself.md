In the past years of my life, I find myself prioritizing family and friends before myself. It may not sound like the worst thing and some people may even call it "generous", but the way I did it was unhealthy.

Growing up in a Chinese family, my parents did a good job in teaching me how to respect others. I spent countless hours thinking about how to make them happy, how to give them what they want, and sometimes even take it a step further and give them more than they asked for. All of that so I can see that extra wide smile, and that extra exclamation mark in a "thank you" text. I believed that seeing them happy is what makes me happy. But it didn't.

As I made more friends, met my girlfriend, got even closer to my family, it started to feel like a full time job. It really suffocated me. I heard a lot of voices in my head but non of them was mine. I chased many goals and dreams but non of them was mine. I failed to meet a lot of expectations but non of that was mine. Over time I started to wonder who I really am and what do I really want in life, but I just couldn't come up with a good answer. All of who I wanted to be, how I wanted to look, what I wanted to do was all reflections of what they wanted. I feel lost and don't know how to shake this feeling off. 

Until one day, I realized what my problem was: I am not my own friend. I never took notice of what I cared about. I spent all of my time trying to become that perfect son, perfect boyfriend, and perfect friend for someone else. Someone else that would maybe leave in a heartbeat because I simply couldn't become who they wanted me to be. That has happened before and that will happen again. But this time I will take a better approach. I need to befriend that one person who will never leave me. I need to befriend myself.
